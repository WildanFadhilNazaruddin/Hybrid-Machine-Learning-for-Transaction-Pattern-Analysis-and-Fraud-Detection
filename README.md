# Hybrid-Machine-Learning-for-Transaction-Pattern-Analysis-and-Fraud-Detection
A machine learning project integrating unsupervised clustering and supervised classification to identify fraud patterns in financial transactions. Using K-Means for label generation and classification models for prediction, this project demonstrates an end-to-end hybrid ML pipeline for fraud detection.
